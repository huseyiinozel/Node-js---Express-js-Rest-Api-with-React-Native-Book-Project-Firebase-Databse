# Node-js---Express-js-Rest-Api-with-React-Native-Book-Project-Firebase-Databse

This application allows you to track the books you have read in a simple way. 
On the first page (Main), you enter the book you have started reading in the "Add" section to indicate that you have started reading it. 
The book will appear on your home page. 
When you finish reading the book, you press the "Finished" button next to it to mark it as read, 
and it will move to the "Old Page" where the read books are listed.

This application was developed using React Native. Firebase/Firestore was used as the database,
and the backend was built using Node.js and Express.js. 
These two applications are connected to each other using a REST API. 
Additionally, the application sends requests to the database every 5 seconds to keep the list up to date,
and any changes made are reflected on the screen immediately.
